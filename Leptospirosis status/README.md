# Leptospirosis Status Prediction

This project predicts the Leptospirosis status of the patient using a Jupyter notebook in the test dataset. The notebook also includes data preprocessing, visualization and analysis to understand the trends and patterns of Leptospirosis cases. The data description is available in lepto_description.xls.

## Contents

- **Data Preprocessing:** Also includes data loading.
- **Descriptive and correlation analysis:** Includes heatmaps, chi square tests.
- **Modelling:** Includes transformations and implementation of a logistic model to predict Leptospirosis status. The model is trained using the train dataset.
- **Predicting:** Accuarcy of the model is 0.85878. The predictions are saved in test_predictions.csv.
