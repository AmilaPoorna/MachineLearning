# Leptospirosis Status Prediction

This project predicts the Leptospirosis status of the patient using a Jupyter notebook in the test dataset. The notebook also includes data preprocessing, visualization and analysis to understand the trends and patterns of Leptospirosis cases.

## Contents

- **Data Preprocessing:** Also includes data loading.
- **Descriptive and correlation analysis:** Includes heatmaps, chi square tests.
- **Modelling:** Includes transformations and implementation of a logistic model to predict Leptospirosis status.
- **Predicting:** Accuarcy of the model is 0.85878.
